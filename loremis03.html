		Allegations of mysterious or suspicious deaths of witnesses connected with the Kennedy assassination originated with journalist Penn Jones Jr.,[79][80] and were covered by Ramparts magazine in October 1966 (the story was picked up by Reuters, and multiple newspapers reported on it at the time). The Ramparts article cited 10 people[c] who died within 3 years of the assassination, including:

Jim Koethe (d. September 21, 1964), one of two reporters[d] who went to Ruby's apartment the night after Ruby shot Oswald. Koethe was killed with a "karate chop on the neck" in his own apartment by an intruder (or intruders).
Bill Hunter (d. April 23, 1964), the other of the two reporters who went to Ruby's apartment the night after Ruby shot Oswald. Killed by a policeman with a gunshot at a police station; the gunshot was deemed accidental.
William Whaley (d. December 1965), the taxi driver who took Oswald from the scene of the assassination. Died in a car crash, alongside the driver of the car which crashed into his cab. Described by Jones Jr. as the "first Dallas cab driver to die on duty since 1937".
Earline Roberts (or Earlene Roberts, d. January 1966), Oswald's landlady (owner of the rooming house where Oswald lived). Died of a heart attack, aged 60 (no autopsy performed).
Tom Howard (d. March 1965), one of Ruby's lawyers (the lead lawyer, according to Jones Jr.). Howard also went to Ruby's apartment with Koethe and Hunter the night after Ruby shot Oswald. Died of a heart attack, age 48, after behaving strangely for a few days and not recognizing his friends (no autopsy performed).
Lee Bowers (d. August 1966), a witness who was in a railway interlocking tower that overlooked Dealey Plaza at the time of the assassination. Died after his car crashed into a bridge abutment.
Hank Killam (d. March 1964), whose wife was a "cigarette girl" (or a dancer) at Ruby's club. Killam later moved to Florida, and died there; he received a phone call at 4 am, after which he went to a building in downtown Pensacola and "jumped or fell" out of a first floor window, and bled to death from cuts to his throat, amid pieces of broken glass.[81]

Edward Benavides (d. February 1965), brother of Domingo Benavides, a key witness in the J. D. Tippit shooting (Domingo Benavides saw the shooter, and entered Tippit's car to radio for help[e]). Died of a gunshot to the head in a bar; no one else was killed in the bar shooting. Jones Jr. implied it was a case of mistaken identity and that Domingo Benavides was the intended victim.
Nancy Jane Mooney, aka Betty McDonald (d. February 1964), a stripper at Jack Ruby's club. Mooney was arrested for fighting with her roommate and reportedly hanged herself in her Dallas jail cell.[82] Mooney had provided an alibi to the suspected shooter of Warren Reynolds, after Reynolds, who said he saw the killer of J. D. Tippit and reported this to the FBI, was shot in the head in January 1964.[83]
The tenth death listed was that of Dorothy Kilgallen (see below). The Ramparts article also referenced witnesses who said that Ruby and Oswald knew each other[83] and that Ruby had "gangland" connections.

In 1973, similar claims about suspicious deaths of witnesses were brought to national attention by the theatrically released movie Executive Action.[79][84] In 1989, Jim Marrs published a list of 103 people he believed had died "convenient deaths" under suspicious circumstances. He noted that the deaths were grouped around investigations conducted by the Warren Commission, New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations.[85] Marrs pointed out that "these deaths certainly would have been convenient for anyone not wishing the truth of the JFK assassination to become public."[86] In 2013, Richard Belzer published Hit List: An In-Depth Investigation into the Mysterious Deaths of Witnesses to the JFK Assassination that examines the deaths of 50 people linked to the assassination and claims most of them were murdered as part of a cover-up.[87]

Vincent Bugliosi devoted two pages of his book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy to journalist Dorothy Kilgallen. Kilgallen was publicly skeptical of the official version of the assassination of President Kennedy and Jack Ruby’s shooting of Lee Oswald. During 1964 and 1965, she wrote several newspaper articles on the subject and many relevant short items in her daily column.[88][89][90] On February 23, 1964, the New York City newspaper New York Journal-American, where Kilgallen had worked since its formation in 1937, published her article about a conversation she had had with Jack Ruby, when he was seated at his defense table during a recess in his murder trial.

Whether Kilgallen and Ruby had a second conversation in a private room in the Dallas County, Texas courthouse several days later has been disputed. If they did, she never wrote about it for publication.[91] One of Kilgallen's biographers, Mark Shaw, contends that even if Ruby did not reveal sensitive information to Kilgallen about the assassination, she still could have learned sensitive information during a trip she made to New Orleans several weeks before she died.[92]

Kilgallen's last brief item about the Kennedy assassination, published on September 3, 1965, ended with these words: "That story isn't going to die as long as there's a real reporter alive – and there are a lot of them alive."[93][94]Two months later, on November 8, 1965, Kilgallen was found dead in her Manhattan townhouse. Her death was determined to have been caused by a combination of alcohol and barbiturates.[95] Bugliosi referred to Kilgallen’s 1965 death as "perhaps the most prominent mysterious death" cited by assassination researchers.[96] He added that the presence of Kilgallen’s husband and son in their five-story townhouse throughout the night when she died proves she could not have been murdered. Bugliosi said an intruder would have awakened her husband or her eleven-year-old son and then the husband would have called the police.[97]

According to author Jerome Kroth, Mafia figures Sam Giancana, John Roselli, Carlos Prio, Jimmy Hoffa, Charles Nicoletti, Leo Moceri, Richard Cain, Salvatore Granello, and Dave Yaras were likely murdered to prevent them from revealing their knowledge.[98] According to author Matthew Smith, others with some tie to the case who have died suspicious deaths include Lee Bowers, Gary Underhill, William Sullivan, David Ferrie, Clay Shaw, George de Mohrenschildt, four showgirls who worked for Jack Ruby, and Ruby himself.[99]

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated another alleged mysterious death – that of Rose Cheramie (sometimes spelled Cherami), whose real name was Melba Christine Mercades.[100][101] The Committee reported that Louisiana State Police Lieutenant Francis Fruge traveled to Eunice, Louisiana, on November 20, 1963 – two days before the assassination – to pick up Cheramie, who had sustained minor injuries when she was hit by a car.[102][103] Fruge drove Cheramie to the hospital and said that on the way there, she "... related to [him] that she was coming from Florida to Dallas with two men who were Italians or resembled Italians." Fruge asked her what she planned to do in Dallas, to which she replied: "... number one, pick up some money, pick up [my] baby, and ... kill Kennedy."[103] Cheramie was admitted and treated at the state hospital in Jackson, Louisiana for alcoholism and heroin addiction. After the assassination, Lt. Fruge contacted Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz regarding what he had learned from Cheramie, but Fritz told him he "wasn't interested".[104]

In the 1970s, a state hospital physician, Dr. Victor Weiss, told a House Select Committee on Assassinations investigator that on November 25 – three days after the assassination – one of his fellow physicians told him that Cheramie had "stated before the assassination that President Kennedy was going to be killed".[105] Dr. Weiss further reported that Cheramie told him after the assassination that she had worked for Jack Ruby and that her knowledge of the assassination originated from "word in the underworld".[103] Cheramie was found dead close to a highway near Big Sandy, Texas on September 4, 1965; she had been run over by a car.[106][107]

Another suspicious death cited by Jim Marrs was that of Joseph Milteer, director of the Dixie Klan of Georgia. Milteer was secretly tape-recorded thirteen days before the assassination telling Miami police informant William Somersett that the murder of Kennedy was "in the working". Milteer died in 1974 when a heater exploded in his house.[108][109][110][111][112] The House Select Committee on Assassinations reported in 1979 that Milteer's information on the threat to the President "was furnished [to] the agents making the advance arrangements before the visit of the President" to Miami, but that "the Milteer threat was ignored by Secret Service personnel in planning the trip to Dallas." Robert Bouck, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Secret Service's Protective Research Section, testified that "threat information was transmitted from one region of the country to another if there was specific evidence it was relevant to the receiving region."[113]

Concerning the Tippit shooting, the Warren Commission named 12 witnesses to the shooting and its aftermath.[114] One of these witnesses, Warren Reynolds, was shot in the head 2 months after the Tippit shooting, but survived. Another witness, Domingo Benavides, who was close to the shooting and saw Tippit fall after being shot, lost his brother 15 months after the Tippit shooting; Benavides' brother was shot in the head in a bar and died.[83]

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investigated the allegation "that a statistically improbable number of individuals with some direct or peripheral association with the Kennedy assassination died as a result of that assassination, thereby raising the specter of conspiracy".[79] The committee's chief of research testified: "Our final conclusion on the issue is that the available evidence does not establish anything about the nature of these deaths which would indicate that the deaths were in some manner, either direct or peripheral, caused by the assassination of President Kennedy or by any aspect of the subsequent investigation."[79]

Author Gerald Posner said that Marrs's list was taken from the group of about 10,000 people connected even in the most tenuous way to the assassination, including people identified in the official investigations, as well as the research of conspiracy theorists. Posner also said that it would be surprising if a hundred people out of ten thousand did not die in "unnatural ways". He noted that over half of the people on Marrs's list did not die mysteriously, but of natural causes, such as Secret Service agent Roy Kellerman, who died of heart failure at age 69 in 1984, long after the Kennedy assassination, but is on Marrs's list as someone whose cause of death is "unknown". Posner also pointed out that many prominent witnesses and conspiracy researchers continue to live long lives.[115]
